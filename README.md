# Paralellogram Drawer
<p>
  This is a simple Javascript tool to draw
  a paralellogram on an HTML5 page using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas</a>.
  It utilizes <a href="http://www.createjs.com/easeljs">easel.js</a> for canvas manipulation and
  <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap CSS</a> for a little bit of styling.
</p>
## How to use
<p>
  Just click around on the canvas and you will see how it works.
  When you click on the canvas, a circle will appear on the spot that you click.
  If you click three times on different spot on the canvas,
  it will draw a paralellogram based on the 3 points that you have selected.
  There is info bar at the bottom where you can see the coordinate of the points and also the area of the paralellogram.
  The area is on pixel unit.
